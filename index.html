								<h2>Scope and Topics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							The AAAI Workshop on Machine Learning for Operations Research (ML4OR) builds on the momentum 
							that has been directed over the past 5 years, in both the OR and ML communities, 
							towards establishing modern ML methods as a “first-class citizen" at all levels of the OR toolkit. 
							</p>
							<p>
							ML4OR will serve as an interdisciplinary forum for researchers in both fields to discuss technical 
							issues at this interface and present ML approaches that apply to basic OR building blocks 
							(e.g., integer programming solvers) or specific applications.
							</p>

							<h3>Topics</h3>
							Topics: ML4OR will place particular emphasis on:
							<ol>
							<li>ML methodologies for enhancing traditional OR algorithms for integer programming, 
							combinatorial optimization, stochastic programming, multi-objective optimization, 
							location and routing problems, etc.; </li>
							<li>Deep Learning (DL) approaches that can exploit large datasets, 
							particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL);</li>
<!-- 							<li>End-to-end learning methodologies that mend the gap between ML model 
							training and downstream optimization problems that use ML predictions as inputs;</li> -->
							<li>Datasets and benchmark libraries that enable ML approaches for a particular 
							OR application or challenging combinatorial problems.</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Format</h3> 
							<p> 
							ML4OR is a one-day workshop consisting of a mix of events: 
							multiple invited talks by recognized speakers from both OR and ML 
							covering central theoretical, algorithmic, and practical challenges 
							at this intersection; a number of technical sessions where researchers 
							briefly present their accepted papers; a virtual poster session for 
							accepted papers and abstracts; a panel discussion with speakers from 
							academia and industry focusing on the state of the field and promising 
							avenues for future research; an educational session on best 
							practices for incorporating ML in advanced OR courses including open 
							software and data, learning outcomes, etc.
							</p>

							<h3>Attendance</h3>
							Attendance is open to all. At least one author of each accepted submission must be present at the workshop.

							<h4>Fast Track (Rejected NeurIPS or AAAI papers)</h4>
							<p>
							Rejected NeurIPS or AAAI papers with *average* scores of at least 5.0 may be submitted  
							to ML4OR along with previous reviews and scores and an optional letter indicating how the 
							authors have addressed the reviewers comments.
							<br>
							Please use the submission link above and indicate that the submission is a resubmission from 
							of an NeurIPS/AAAI rejected paper. 
							<br>
							These submissions will not undergo the regular review process, but a light one, and will be 
							accepted if the previous reviews are judged to meet the workshop standard. 
							</p>

							<p>	
							All papers must be submitted in PDF format, using the 
							<a href="https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit22.zip">AAAI-22 author kit</a>. 
							Submissions should include the name(s), affiliations, and email addresses of all authors. 
							<br>
							Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, significance, and 
							clarity. Each submission will be thoroughly reviewed by at least two program committee members.
							<br>
							Submissions of papers rejected from the NeurIPS 2021 and AAAI 2022 technical program are welcomed.

                            <h3>Sample Complexity of Tree Search Configuration: Cutting Planes and Beyond - Ellen Vitercik [09:05-09:50]</h3>
                            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Cutting-plane methods have enabled remarkable successes in integer programming over the last few decades. State-of-the-art solvers integrate a myriad of cutting-plane techniques to speed up the underlying tree search algorithm used to find optimal solutions. In this talk, we provide the first sample complexity guarantees for learning high-performing cut-selection policies tailored to the instance distribution at hand using samples. We then develop a general abstraction of tree search that captures key components such as node selection and variable selection. For this abstraction, we bound the sample complexity of learning a good policy for building the search tree. Finally, we describe how our techniques can be generalized to cover a diversity of other combinatorial algorithm configuration problems, including clustering, computational biology, and greedy algorithm configuration.
                                This talk is based on joint work with Nina Balcan, Dan DeBlasio, Travis Dick, Carl Kingsford, Siddharth Prasad, and Tuomas Sandholm.

                            <h3>Generalization and Extrapolation in Graph Neural Networks for Learning Combinatorial Algorithms - Stefanie Jegelka [10:05-11:50] </h3>
                            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool for learning certain algorithmic tasks, in particular related to combinatorial optimization. In this talk, we will focus on the “algorithmic reasoning” task of learning a full algorithm. While GNNs have shown promising empirical results, their generalization properties are less well understood. In particular, the task and data properties, architecture and learning algorithm all affect the results. For instance, empirically, we observe an interplay between the structure of the task — or target algorithm — and the inductive biases of the architecture: although many networks may be able to represent a task, some architectures learn it better than others. I will show an approach to formalize this relationship, and empirical and theoretical implications for generalization within and out of the training distribution. Our results suggest that a strong alignment between model and task can enable extrapolation, and, in particular, nonlinearities play a key role.
                                This talk is based on joint work with Keyulu Xu, Jingling Li, Mozhi Zhang, Simon S. Du and Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi.

                            <h3>What Does It Mean To Prefer The Fastest Algorithm? - Kevin Leyton-Brown [13:15-14:00]</h3>
                            <p><b>Abstract:</b>
				It is surprisingly difficult to identify a defensible, general rule describing when we prefer one runtime distribution to another, particularly if we have only a bounded amount of time for performing each run and not all runs will terminate. (We restrict our attention to settings in which all algorithm runs produce exact, correct answers, and where we care only about runtimes; think e.g. of complete SAT or MIP solvers.) Identifying such a scoring function is critical when we use machine learning approaches to learn new algorithms from data, as in the case of algorithm configuration. 
				<br>
				This talk describes a new, utility-theoretic answer to the question of how we should formalize our preferences between arbitrary pairs of algorithms. It leverages axiomatic assumptions about preferences over runtime distributions to prove the existence of a scoring function and to identify its properties. This function depends on the way our value for a solution decreases with time and on the distribution from which captimes are drawn.  We describe a maximum-entropy approach to modeling captime distributions and show how our overall framework can be applied in a variety of realistic scenarios.
