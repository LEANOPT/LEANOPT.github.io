								<h2>Scope and Topics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							The AAAI Workshop on Learnable Optimization (LEANOPT) builds on the momentum that has
								been directed over the past 6 years, in both the operations research (OR) and machine
								learning (ML) communities, towards establishing modern ML methods as a “first-class
								citizen” at all levels of the OR toolkit.
							</p>
							<p>
							While much progress has been made, many challenges remain due in part to data uncertainty,
								the hard constraints inherent to OR problems, and the high stakes involved. LEANOPT
								will serve as an interdisciplinary forum for researchers in OR and ML to discuss
								technical issues at this interface and present new ML approaches and software tools
								that accelerate classical optimization algorithms (e.g., for continuous, combinatorial,
								mixed-integer, stochastic optimization) as well as novel applications.
							</p>

							<h3>Topics</h3>
							LEANOPT will place particular emphasis on:
							<ol>
							<li>Learning to optimize (L2O) methods for solving constrained optimization problems. </li>
							<li>Predict-then-optimize/decision-focused learning.</li>
							<li>ML for heuristic and exact algorithms.</li>
							<li>New Graph Neural Networks for solving constrained optimization problems.</li>
							<li>MReinforcement Learning approaches for dynamic decision-making.</li>
								<li>New applications that can benefit from learnable optimization under uncertainty.</li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Format</h3> 
							<p> 
							While we are planning an in-person workshop to be held at AAAI-23. LEANOPT will be a one-day workshop
								consisting of a mix of events: multiple invited talks by recognized speakers from both OR and ML
								covering central theoretical, algorithmic, and practical challenges at this intersection;
								a poster session for accepted abstracts;
								and hands-on programming session featuring two open-source libraries NeuroMANCER and PyEPO.
							</p>

							<h3>Attendance</h3>
							We aim to accommodate an audience of up to 50 attendees. The attendees will be a mix of workshop organizers,
							invited speakers, and invited researchers with accepted abstracts.

	                    <h3>Title: Optimization meets AI: trustworthy decisions via the scenario approach  [14:45-15:30]</h3>
                            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Model-based design approaches are increasingly proving insufficient to cope with the growing complexity
								of contemporary science and engineering. This has given way to the ascendancy of learning-based methods,
								able to leverage a posteriori knowledge coming from observations to make designs without the need to reconstruct
								the underlying data generation mechanism. However, ensuring the reliability of solutions obtained through
								learning-based approaches necessitates the development of truly new theoretical foundations. This presentation aims to
								introduce the scenario approach, a relatively recent, yet firmly established, framework for learning-based optimization
								and decision-making. Within this framework, recent developments have unveiled a profound and broadly applicable
								connection between the "risk" - defined as the probability of underperforming on new, out-of-sample data -
								and an observable quantity, called "complexity". While this result reveals that data contain more information than expected,
								it also enables the attainment of tight assessments of the risk,
								opening the door to a dependable usage of learning-based methods in automated, human-free, decision-making.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Bio:</b> Simone Garatti received both his M.S. and Ph.D. in Information Technology from the the Politecnico di Milano,
								Italy, in 2000 and 2004, respectively. After graduating, he joined the Faculty of the Politecnico di Milano,
								where he currently holds a position of Associate Professor in the Automatic Control area at the Dipartimento di
								Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria. He also held visiting positions at some prestigious foreign universities,
								like the University of California San Diego (UCSD) (as winner of a fellowship for the short-term mobility of researchers
								from the National Research Council of Italy), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and the University of Oxford.
								From 2013 to 2019 he served for the EUCA Conference Editorial Board, while he is currently member of the IEEE-CSS Conference
								Editorial Board and Associate Editor for the International Journal of Adaptive Control and Signal Processing and for
								the Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction journal. He is also member of the IFAC Technical Committee on Modeling,
								Identification and Signal Processing, of the IEEE-CSS Technical Committee on Robust and Complex Systems, and of
								the IEEE-CSS Technical Committee on System Identification and Adaptive Control. Simone Garatti is one the founders of
								the theory of the scenario approach, a unitary framework to make designs where the effect of uncertainty is controlled
								by knowledge drawn from past experience, and in recognition of his contributions, he was invited speakers at various workshops,
								he was keynote speaker in the IEEE 3rd Conference on Norbert Wiener in the 21st Century in 2021, and he gave
								a semi-plenary address in the 2022 European Conference on Stochastic Optimization and Computational Management Science (ECSO-CMS).
								Simone Garatti is the author/co-author of the book "Introduction to the Scenario Approach" published by SIAM in 2018
								and of more than 100 contributions in international journals, international books, and proceedings of international conferences.
								Besides data-driven optimization and decision-making,
								his research interests also include system identification, uncertainty quantification, and machine learning.

								<h2>Open-source Code Tutorial Session</h2>
							</header>

							<p>This two-hour long session will provide hands-on code tutorials in the form of well documented jupyter notebooks
							introducing two popular open-source libraries integrating constrained optimization with deep learning.
								</p>


							<h3><a href="https://github.com/khalil-research/PyEPO">PyEPO</a>   - Bo Tang  [16:00-17:00]</h3>
                            <p><b>Summary:</b> PyEPO (PyTorch-based End-to-End Predict-then-Optimize Tool) is a Python-based,
								open-source software that supports modeling and solving predict-then-optimize problems with the linear objective function.
								The core capability of PyEPO is to build optimization models with GurobiPy, Pyomo, or any other solvers and algorithms,
								then embed the optimization model into an artificial neural network for the end-to-end training.
								For this purpose, PyEPO implements various methods as PyTorch autograd modules.

							<h3> <a href="https://github.com/pnnl/neuromancer">NeuroMANCER</a>   - Jan Drgona  [17:00-18:00]</h3>
                            <p><b>Summary:</b> Neural Modules with Adaptive Nonlinear Constraints and Efficient Regularizations (NeuroMANCER)
								is an open-source differentiable programming (DP) library for solving parametric constrained optimization problems,
								physics-informed system identification, and parametric model-based optimal control. NeuroMANCER is written
								in PyTorch and allows for systematic integration of machine learning with scientific computing
								for creating end-to-end differentiable models and algorithms embedded with prior knowledge and physics.
